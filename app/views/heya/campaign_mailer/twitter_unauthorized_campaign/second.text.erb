Hi @<%= @user.username %>,

Tweet Sweeper has been disconnected with your Twitter account a week. Because of this, Tweet Sweeper hasn't been able to find or delete any of your tweets.

To reconnect to Twitter, just head over to https://tweetsweeper.app/ and sign in again.

Sorry for the interruption.
