Tweet Sweeper was looking for @<%= @user.username %>'s tweets but was unable to find that account!

Did you recently delete your Twitter account? 

If so, reply to this email and let me know. I'll cancel any active subscriptions you may have and remove your data from Tweet Sweeper.

If not, something else went gone wrong. Reconnect your Twitter accont by heading to https://tweetsweeper.app and signing in again.

Thanks,
Pete (@pbmarcano)
